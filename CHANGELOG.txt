CHANGELOG

### v2.9 - ASCII Art Fix (Feb 1, 2026)

#### Fixes
- **ASCII Art Rendering:** Fixed garbled ASCII logo display by loading art from `ascii.txt` file instead of hardcoded HTML. Preserves exact spacing and alignment.
- **Venv Path Fix:** Updated virtual environment activate script paths after project rebrand from `mysqlhelper` to `yourSQLfriend`.

### v2.7 - UX/UI Polish & Improvements (Feb 1, 2026)

#### UX Improvements
- **Database Loading State:** Added status chip above chat input showing "No database loaded" vs filename. Chat input disabled until database loaded.
- **Unified LLM Status:** Both LM Studio and Ollama now show connection status on page load (was Ollama only). Health check runs every 30 seconds.
- **Better Onboarding:** Added file type hints (.db .sqlite .csv .sql) below drop zone. Added example queries on welcome screen.
- **Collapsible Schema:** Tables are now collapsible (click to expand/collapse columns). Shows table count badge and column count per table.
- **Upload Progress:** Shows spinner on drop zone during file upload with "Uploading filename..." text.

#### UI Polish
- **Light Theme Contrast:** Darkened `--primary` (#d08010 → #b06800) and `--foreground-muted` (#8a8a9a → #5a5a6a) for WCAG AA compliance.
- **CSS Cleanup:** Moved inline styles from note editor JS to CSS classes. Enables proper theme support for notes.
- **Animation Optimization:** Sidebar now uses GPU-accelerated `transform: translateX()` instead of `margin-left`.
- **Tablet Breakpoint:** Added 1024px breakpoint with adjusted sidebar width (260px) for better tablet experience.
- **Token Counter Layout:** Changed from absolute positioning to `float: right` for consistent layout across messages.

### v2.6 - UI/UX Fixes & SQL Validation Improvements (Feb 1, 2026)

#### UI Fixes
- **Scrollbar Visibility:** Changed default scrollbar color from dark gray to orange theme color (`--primary-dark`). Hover state now shows brighter orange (`--primary`).
- **Firefox Scrollbar Support:** Added `scrollbar-color` property for Firefox compatibility.
- **Table Column Alignment:** Fixed sticky header desync during horizontal scroll. Reduced `min-width` from 120px to 80px, added `max-width: 400px` with text truncation.
- **Header z-index:** Increased from 1 to 10 to prevent overlap issues.

#### Grid.js Changes
- Disabled column resizing (was causing alignment issues).
- Enabled `fixedHeader` for better scroll behavior.
- Added `thead` sticky positioning for full-row header fix.

#### SQL Validation
- **Smarter Multi-Statement Detection:** Added `strip_strings_and_comments()` helper that removes string literals and comments before checking for multiple statements.
- **False Positive Fixes:** Queries with semicolons inside strings (`SELECT 'a;b'`) or trailing comments (`SELECT * FROM t; -- note`) now pass validation.
- **Security Preserved:** Actual multi-statement attacks still blocked; forbidden keywords check unchanged.

### v2.5 - Ollama Integration & Security Hardening (Feb 1, 2026)

#### Features
- **Dual LLM Provider Support:** Switch between LM Studio and Ollama via dropdown in sidebar.

- **Request Validation:** All POST endpoints now validate `request.json` is not None before accessing.
- **Error Message Escaping:** Search error messages now escaped to prevent injection.

#### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/ollama/status` - Check Ollama availability and list models
- `POST /api/ollama/model` - Set active Ollama model for session
- `GET /api/provider/status` - Unified provider status check

#### Environment Variables
