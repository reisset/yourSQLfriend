CHANGELOG

### v1.3 - Sidebar UI Polish & Export Fix
- **UI:** Redesigned sidebar with organized sections: "Database Source", "Actions", and "Schema".
- **Polish:** Removed floating header, added uppercase section labels with subtle borders for cleaner organization.
- **Fix:** Resolved token counter text overlap in exported HTML files by adding proper padding.
- **Export:** Token counters now render cleanly in exported chat sessions without covering text.

### v1.2 - Token Usage Tracking
- **Feature:** Display token usage in top-right of LLM chat bubbles showing per-message and cumulative totals.
- **Details:** Hover over token counter to see prompt/completion breakdown.
- **Backend:** Captures token usage from LM Studio API (v0.3.18+) via stream_options parameter.
- **Session:** Token data persists in session and is included in HTML exports.
- **Compatibility:** Graceful degradation for older LM Studio versions - no errors if token data unavailable.

### v1.1 - UI/UX Polish & Robustness
- **UI:** Fixed "double scrollbar" issues and optimized layout for windowed modes.
- **Safety:** Added confirmation dialogs when uploading a new database during an active chat.
- **Export:** Enhanced chat export to perfectly mirror the application's visual style and layout.
- **Fix:** Resolved event listener conflicts preventing double-submission on upload.
