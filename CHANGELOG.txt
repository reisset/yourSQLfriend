CHANGELOG

### v1.4 - Forensic Hardening & Security
- **Feature:** Added SHA256 hashing for all uploaded evidence files.
- **Feature:** Implemented comprehensive audit logging (`logs/`) with daily rotation.
- **Feature:** Enhanced "Export Chat" with professional forensic report header (Hash, timestamps, analyst info).
- **Feature:** Added support for importing `.csv` (auto-converted to SQLite) and `.sql` dump files.
- **AI Persona:** Refined LLM system prompt to act as a "Forensics Assistant" with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
- **AI Stability:** Fixed context drift by pinning schema to system prompt.
- **Robustness:** Added backend timeouts (60s) and frontend watchdog (15s) to prevent "infinite spinner" hangs.
- **Security:** Added strict file validation (extension, magic bytes, size limits).
- **Security:** Implemented global error handling for 404/500 events.
- **UX:** Added client-side file size warnings (>100MB) and blocking (>1GB).
- **UX:** Added smart troubleshooting guide for LLM connection failures.

### v1.2 - Token Usage Tracking
- **Feature:** Display token usage in top-right of LLM chat bubbles showing per-message and cumulative totals.
- **Details:** Hover over token counter to see prompt/completion breakdown.
- **Backend:** Captures token usage from LM Studio API (v0.3.18+) via stream_options parameter.
- **Session:** Token data persists in session and is included in HTML exports.
- **Compatibility:** Graceful degradation for older LM Studio versions - no errors if token data unavailable.

### v1.1 - UI/UX Polish & Robustness
- **UI:** Fixed "double scrollbar" issues and optimized layout for windowed modes.
- **Safety:** Added confirmation dialogs when uploading a new database during an active chat.
- **Export:** Enhanced chat export to perfectly mirror the application's visual style and layout.
- **Fix:** Resolved event listener conflicts preventing double-submission on upload.
